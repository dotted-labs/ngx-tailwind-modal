description: Fix an error in the codebase using the context7 MCP
---

build, lint and run the project. READ the output from the terminal command to understand the error that is being displayed.
THEN FIX the error. Use `context7` MCP to search the library documentation to understand the error and `sequential-thinking` MCP to fix the error.

THEN re-run the command in the terminal. If there is another error, repeat this debugging process.

Think carefully and only action the specific task I have given you with the most concise and elegant solution that changes as little code as possible
