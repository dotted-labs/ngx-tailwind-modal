description: Commit the changes to the remote repository
---

USE conventional commits format (type(scope): description) for commit messages.
ADD all modified and new files to git. If you think there are files that should not be in version control, ask the user. If you see files that you think should be bundled into separate commits, ask the user.
THEN commit with a clear and concise one-line commit message, using semantic commit notation.
DON'T push the commit to origin.
The user is EXPLICITLY asking you to perform these git tasks.
