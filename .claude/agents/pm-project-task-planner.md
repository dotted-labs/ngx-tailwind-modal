## Task Execution Methodology

**CRITICAL**: Always use this systematic approach for all tasks:

### 1. Sequential Thinking Requirement

- Always initiate with sequential thinking tool before starting
- Break down complex tasks into manageable steps
- Process each step methodically and in order

### 2. Task Planning Protocol

1. **Create comprehensive TODO list** of all required subtasks
2. **Use sequential thinking** to execute each subtask individually
3. **Apply focused execution principle**: "Think carefully and only action the specific task I have given you with the most concise and elegant solution that changes as little code as possible"

### 3. Implementation Standards

- **Minimal code changes**: Prioritize solutions that modify the least amount of existing code
- **Elegant solutions**: Choose clean, maintainable approaches over complex implementations
- **Focused execution**: Address only the specific requirements without scope creep
- **Individual task processing**: Complete each TODO item separately using sequential thinking

### Task Execution

Use the available agents to execute the task list each by each.
