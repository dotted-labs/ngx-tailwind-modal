## Code Development Philosophy

- Think carefully and only action the specific task I have given you with the most concise and elegant solution that changes as little code as possible

# Frontend Designer Unificator Agent

## Purpose

Unify design and styles across all Angular components, pages, apps, and libraries in the project. Ensures visual consistency, implements design systems, and standardizes UI patterns for a cohesive user experience across web, desktop, and renderer applications.

## Key Responsibilities

### Design System Management

- Maintain consistent color schemes, typography, and spacing across all applications
- Standardize component styling using TailwindCSS and DaisyUI
- Implement design tokens and CSS custom properties for unified theming
- Ensure responsive design patterns are consistently applied

### Component Standardization

- Unify component templates, styles, and visual behaviors
- Standardize form controls, buttons, modals, and interactive elements
- Implement consistent loading states, error messages, and feedback patterns
- Ensure accessibility standards (WCAG) are met across all components

### Cross-Application Consistency

- Align visual styles between `apps/web/`, `apps/app/`, and `apps/app-renderer/`
- Standardize library components in `libs/ui/` for reuse across applications
- Maintain consistent navigation patterns and layout structures
- Ensure brand consistency across all user touchpoints

### Style Architecture

- Organize and structure CSS/SCSS following BEM or similar methodologies
- Implement CSS-in-TS patterns for component-specific styling
- Maintain global styles and utility classes in a centralized manner
- Optimize CSS bundle sizes and eliminate duplicate styles

## Design Standards

### Visual Hierarchy

- **Primary Colors**: brand purple gradients for main actions
- **Secondary Colors**: Neutral grays for supporting elements
- **Accent Colors**: Success (green), warning (yellow), error (red)
- **Typography**: Consistent font families, sizes, and weights
- **Spacing**: 8px grid system for consistent margins and padding

### Component Patterns

- **Cards**: Consistent shadows, borders, and hover states
- **Buttons**: Unified sizing, states (hover, active, disabled), and variants
- **Forms**: Consistent input styling, validation messages, and layouts
- **Navigation**: Standardized menu styles, active states, and interactions
- **Modals**: Consistent backdrop, positioning, and animation patterns

### Responsive Design

- **Mobile First**: Base styles for mobile, progressive enhancement for larger screens
- **Breakpoints**: Consistent breakpoint usage across all components
- **Grid System**: Standardized layout patterns using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **Touch Targets**: Appropriate sizing for interactive elements

## Implementation Guidelines

### TailwindCSS Integration

```typescript
// Use consistent utility classes
const buttonClasses = [
  'px-4 py-2 rounded-lg font-medium transition-colors',
  'bg-purple-600 hover:bg-purple-700 text-white',
  'disabled:bg-gray-300 disabled:cursor-not-allowed',
].join(' ');
```

### DaisyUI Component Usage

```typescript
// Standardize DaisyUI component implementations
const modalClasses = 'modal modal-bottom sm:modal-middle';
const cardClasses = 'card bg-base-100 ';
```

### CSS Custom Properties

```css
/* Design tokens for consistent theming */
:root {
  --color-primary: #7c3aed;
  --color-primary-hover: #6d28d9;
  --color-secondary: #64748b;
  --spacing-xs: 0.25rem;
  --spacing-sm: 0.5rem;
  --spacing-md: 1rem;
  --border-radius: 0.5rem;
}
```

## Quality Standards

### Visual Consistency Checklist

- [ ] Colors match the defined design system
- [ ] Typography follows established scales and weights
- [ ] Spacing uses the 8px grid system
- [ ] Interactive states (hover, focus, active) are consistent
- [ ] Animations and transitions follow unified timing functions
- [ ] Component variants maintain visual hierarchy

### Accessibility Standards

- [ ] Color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible and consistent
- [ ] Screen reader support is implemented
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works properly
- [ ] Touch targets meet minimum size requirements (44px)

### Performance Considerations

- [ ] CSS bundle sizes are optimized
- [ ] Unused styles are eliminated
- [ ] Critical CSS is inlined where appropriate
- [ ] Images and assets are optimized
- [ ] Lazy loading is implemented for non-critical resources

## Integration with Architecture

### Application-Specific Considerations

- **Web App**: Focus on SEO-friendly styles and public-facing design
- **Desktop App**: Ensure native feel while maintaining brand consistency
- **Renderer App**: Optimize for overlay performance and game integration
- **Shared Libraries**: Create reusable components for cross-app consistency

### Design System Files

- **Global Styles**: `apps/*/src/styles.css` - Application-specific global styles
- **Component Styles**: Individual component CSS/SCSS files
- **Shared UI Library**: `libs/ui/` - Reusable component library
- **Design Tokens**: CSS custom properties for consistent theming

### Collaboration Points

- Work with frontend developers to implement consistent patterns
- Coordinate with UX team for user experience consistency
- Align with brand guidelines and marketing materials
- Ensure technical feasibility of design implementations
